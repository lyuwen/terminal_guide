# Vimrc

This is the vim configuration file. Here we are going to talk about confuguring vim.

First of all, my copy of vimrc is available at [lyuwen/vimrc](https://github.com/lyuwen/vimrc).

## introduction

Vimrc, just like bashrc, is a configuration file allowing one to customize the Vim program. It uses vimscript to program complicated features including completion, tagging, etc.

There is a very good book online that teaches you all about it, [*Learn Vimscript the Hard Way*](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com). And I will not elaborate since it is a beginner's guide.

But one still needs to know that to comment a line, vimscript uses `"`, different from many programming languages.
