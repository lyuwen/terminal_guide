# Plugins

There many plugin managers for vim. In my vimrc, I am using vimplug since it is light weight and very easy to use. There are already a few plugins in my configuration file, those enables basic features including autocompletion, tags, commenting, status bar, directory indexing.

To browse for for zillions of plugins available on the internet, there is an awesome web set called [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com).
