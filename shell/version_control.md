# Version Control

My first choice of version control software is git, it is obvious since I am hosting this site on github.

It is nice when many weeks or months later, when you find an error you made which should not be there,
you would want to go back like in a time travel, to find where did it begin. Version control allows you
to do that. 

And it is also a good place to hold collaborative works while every one can contribute there
own thoughts and merge them together. Somebody might say not MS Word, Apple Pages or Google Docs can already
do that in real time. But for coding, you wouldn't want to be supprised when somebody added a line of code
that would break when you want to test the changes you made just a while ago.

Actually, this is not a perfect justification. But, anyway, the ability to track changes and manipulate 
changes is really awesome.

To find out all about git one can refer to the [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/doc) website, where there are
[man pages](https://git-scm.com/docs) and 
[cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf). Man pages are also
accessible in `man` command.

Here we are going to introduce a few tweeks and about merge/cherry-pick. I probably would give a more detailed
and plain introduction to each git command in the future.


## A few settings

* For version controling large files, there is an extension called [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

* To look at the changes in the git
